\b trajectory_planner_nodelet is a package that generates a few number of trajectories from an header file with two structures with ackermann angles and arc measurements.

This package uses two classes, c_trajectory and c_manage_trajectory

<h1>  How to use? </h1>
\section Usage c_trajectory

<h2>  c_trajectory class  </h2>
This class is very simple to use, because you just need to give 3 input parameters. A structure of alphas (ackermann angles), arcs and speed (not very important yet). 
The rest of the class is responsible to calculate the coordinates of the vehicle during the movement. After that, some markers are created, to perform a visual simulation of the movement and orientations.

<h2>  The nodelet  </h2>
To use the nodelet, you just need to perfom two actions:

\section Usage c_manage_trajectory

<h2>  c_manage_trajectory class  </h2>
This class receive from the trajectory genarator a trajectory. It will be analized, to determine its overall score, depending on a few weight parameters.. The evaluations methods are:

- Distance to attractor point;

- Angular difference to attractor point;

- Free Space;

- Distance to Laser obstacles

This class returns a vizual marker with the trajectory evaluation paramenters values and its final weight.

\section Usage Execution node
After being generated and evaluated, the trajectory with the higher final overall score must be followed. The node responsible to perform that is the trajectory_executive. It publishes a message with the speed and sirection parameters that the vehicle should have at each moment.
